A game of lunar lander built using C# in the MonoGame framework.

## Project Description

The TRS-80 had limited graphics, 128 x 48 (rectangular, not square) pixels, difficult to make graphically engaging games. While it was limited in capability, some good games were made for it, including a lunar lander style game.

Write an Lunar Lander game. The following wiki [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_%281979_video_game%29) offers a history of the concept and game.
